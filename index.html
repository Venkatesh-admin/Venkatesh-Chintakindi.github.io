  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>As a dedicated data engineer, I specialize in designing, building, and optimizing data systems to drive impactful insights. My career started as a Python developer, where I worked on a no-code platform recommendation engine, focusing on data extraction, pipeline cleaning, incremental load processes, and ensuring code quality through robust coverage.</p>
    <p>I further developed my skills working on computer vision solutions, such as face recognition and smart CCTV systems, where I contributed to database design, API development, containerization, and deployment across various environments.</p>
    <p>To strengthen my technical foundation, I pursued a PG program in Data Engineering, which deepened my knowledge of cloud-based data solutions and modern data infrastructure. I am passionate about solving data challenges, streamlining data workflows, and helping organizations leverage data to make smarter, data-driven decisions.</p>
    <p>Outside of work, I enjoy researching new data technologies and watching podcasts on tech, life, and Indian mythology.</p>
